                    <h2>Grey's Chinese Journey</h2>
                    <p class="first">I'm a college soph&shy;omore and first-year Chinese student, but I started learning Chinese at the age
                        of four. Not only are my mom and dad, my dad's parents, and my mom's parents all not Chinese,
                        but there's also not a single Chinese person in my im&shy;mediate family.</p>

                    <p>My mom told me that when I was three years old I asked them, "Why don't I take Chinese classes?"
                        And they said, "Be&shy;cause we're not Chinese." Then I said, "But my best friend takes Chinese
                        classes!" And my parents told me, "That's because <em>she's</em> Chinese."</p>

                    <p>I asked them every day to let me take Chinese classes, and several months later, they agreed. A
                        few years later, my best friend moved away and I couldn't see her anymore, but I still con&shy;tinued
                        to take Chinese classes.</p>

                    <p>When I was six I started going to a Sat&shy;urday school, called East Bay Chinese School. At first, I
                        didn't know a single person there. I was so nervous! The classes got harder and harder, and I
                        didn't know anyone outside of class who spoke Chinese so I had no way to practice. Because it
                        was so hard for me, my dad started to learn with me. He helped me with Chinese even while he was
                        working. He's a really great dad! We would practice to&shy;gether every week.</p>

                    <p>But my dad wasn't actually a student, so around the time I was taking second-year and third-year
                        Chinese the classes were a lot harder than the first year and he didn't have the time to help me
                        anymore. From that point on I only prac&shy;ticed one or two hours a week, and as I grew up I got
                        even busier. After every test, I forgot all the vocab&shy;ulary and grammar I had learned.</p>

                    <p>Even though I've been studying Chinese for so many years, before I started taking classes in
                        college I couldn't speak Chinese very well at all. Well, I still think I don't think my Chinese
                        is that good, but this class is really im&shy;portant to me. It inspired me to learn even more, and to
                        continue learning for the foreseeable future.</p>
