00:10.001 --> 00:15.999
I'm a college sophomore,
first-year Chinese student,

3
00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
but I started learning
Chinese at the age of four.

4
00:21.001 --> 00:24.000
Not only are my mom and dad,

5
00:24.001 --> 00:25.000
my dad's parents,

6
00:25.001 --> 00:26.000
and my mom's parents

7
00:26.001 --> 00:28.000
all not Chinese,

8
00:28.001 --> 00:32.999
but there's also not a single
Chinese person in my immediate family.

9
00:34.000 --> 00:35.500
My mom told me

10
00:35.501 --> 00:39.000
that when I was three
years old I asked them,

11
00:39.001 --> 00:43.000
"Why don't I take Chinese classes?"

12
00:43.001 --> 00:47.500
And they said, "Because
we're not Chinese."

13
00:47.501 --> 00:48.500
[chuckles]

14
00:48.501 --> 00:52.500
Then I said, "But my best
friend takes Chinese classes!"

15
00:52.501 --> 00:58.000
And my parents told me,
"That's because <i>she's</i> Chinese."

16
00:58.501 --> 01:03.000
I asked them every day to
let me take Chinese classes.

17
01:03.001 --> 01:07.500
And several months
later, they agreed.

18
01:08.000 --> 01:13.000
A few years later,
my best friend moved away,

19
01:13.001 --> 01:16.000
and I couldn't see
her anymore,

20
01:16.001 --> 01:20.000
but I still continued
to take Chinese classes.

21
01:20.001 --> 01:25.500
When I was six I started
going to a Saturday school,

22
01:25.501 --> 01:28.250
called East Bay Chinese School.

23
01:28.750 --> 01:33.500
At first, I didn't know
a single person there.


24
01:33.501 --> 01:34.999
I was so nervous!

25
01:36.000 --> 01:38.250
The classes got harder and harder

26
01:38.251 --> 01:43.750
and I didn't know anyone
outside of class who spoke Chinese

27
01:43.751 --> 01:45.500
so I had no way to practice.

28
01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
Because it was
so hard for me,

29
01:50.001 --> 01:53.500
my dad started
to learn with me.

30
01:53.501 --> 01:57.250
He helped me with Chinese
even while he was working.

31
01:57.251 --> 02:00.250
He's a really great dad!

32
02:01.000 --> 2:05.000
We would practice
together every week

33
02:05.001 --> 02:11.250
But my dad wasn't
actually a student,

34
02:11.251 --> 02:16.500
so around the time I was taking
second-year and third-year Chinese

35
02:16.501 --> 02:18.750
he didn't have the time to help me anymore,

36
02:18.751 --> 02:24.999
and the classes were also a
lot harder than the first year.

37
02:25.000 --> 02:32.500
From that point on I only
practiced one or two hours a week

38
02:32.501 --> 02:36.000
And as I grew up, I got even busier.

39
02:36.001 --> 02:43.000
After every test, I forgot all the
vocabulary and grammar I had learned.

40
02:43.001 --> 02:49.000
Even though I've been studying
Chinese for so many years,

41
02:49.001 --> 02:53.000
before I started taking Chinese in college

42
02:54.000 --> 2:56.500
I couldn't speak Chinese very well at all.

43
02:57.000 --> 03:01.999
Well, I still think I don't
think my Chinese is that good.

44
03:02.000 --> 03:02.500
[chuckles]

45
03:02.501 --> 03:05.250
But this class is really important to me.

47
03:05.251 --> 03:10.250
It inspired me to learn even more, and to 
continue learning for the foreseeable future.
