WEBVTT - Grey's Chinese Journey: Original Audio, English Subtitles (Made with VTT Creator)

1
00:09.000 --> 00:14.450
I'm a college sophomore,
first-year Chinese student,

2
00:14.451 --> 00:20.125
but I started learning
Chinese at the age of four.

3
00:21.000 --> 00:24.050
Not only are my mom and dad,

4
00:24.051 --> 00:25.652
my dad's parents,

5
00:25.652 --> 00:27.790
my mom's parents,

6
00:27.791 --> 00:29.790
all not Chinese,

7
00:29.791 --> 00:35.700
but there's also not a single
Chinese person in my immediate family.

8
00:38.000 --> 00:39.500
My mom told me

9
00:40.076 --> 00:43.207
that when I was three
years old I asked them,

10
00:43.845 --> 00:46.898
"Why don't I take Chinese classes?"

11
00:46.899 --> 00:53.017
And they said, "Because
we're not Chinese."

12
00:52.980 --> 00:56.500
Then I said, "But my best
friend takes Chinese classes!"

13
00:58.660 --> 01:05.060
And my parents told me,
"That's because <i>she's</i> Chinese."

14
01:05.575 --> 01:10.771
I asked them every day to
let me take Chinese classes

15
01:10.788 --> 01:14.483
And several months
later, they agreed.

16
01:14.797 --> 01:20.668
A few years later,
my best friend moved away,

17
01:20.684 --> 01:23.969
and I couldn't see
her anymore,

18
01:24.008 --> 01:28.008
but I still continued
to take Chinese classes.

19
01:28.745 --> 01:35.501
When I was six I started
going to a Saturday school,

20
01:35.503 --> 01:38.168
called East Bay Chinese School.

21
01:38.177 --> 01:44.867
At first, I didn't know
a single person there.

22
01:44.868 --> 01:47.288
I was so nervous!

23
01:48.084 --> 01:51.218
The classes got harder and harder

24
01:51.228 --> 01:59.361
and I didn't know anyone
outside of class who spoke Chinese

25
02:00.217 --> 02:03.572
so I had no way to practice.

26
02:04.440 --> 02:08.670
Because it was
so hard for me,

27
02:08.683 --> 02:12.330
my dad started
to learn with me.

28
02:13.223 --> 02:19.233
He helped me with Chinese
even while he was working.

29
02:19.467 --> 02:23.032
He's a really great dad!

30
02:23.642 --> 02:29.349
We would practice
together every week

31
02:29.428 --> 02:32.998
But my dad wasn't
actually a student,

32
02:33.137 --> 02:38.010
so around the time I was taking
second-year and third-year Chinese

33
02:38.166 --> 02:40.166
he didn't have the time to help me anymore,

34
02:40.849 --> 02:48.629
and the classes were also a
lot harder than the first year.

35
02:49.752 --> 02:57.753
From that point on I only
practiced one or two hours a week

36
02:58.458 --> 03:04.210
And as I grew up, I got even busier.

37
03:04.300 --> 03:11.315
After every test, I forgot all the
vocabulary and grammar I had learned.

38
03:11.697 --> 03:16.193
Even though I've been studying
Chinese for so many years,

39
03:16.243 --> 03:20.418
before I started taking Chinese in college

40
03:20.542 --> 03:24.042
I couldn't speak Chinese very well at all.

41
03:25.171 --> 03:29.481
Well, I still think I don't
think my Chinese is that good.

42
03:29.612 --> 03:33.407
But this class is really important to me.

43
03:33.845 --> 03:38.070
It inspired me to learn even more, and to 
continue learning for the foreseeable future.
